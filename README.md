# GameStoreAgeBypass

This repository contains a userscript designed to bypass age verification gates on both the Epic Games Store and Steam platforms, allowing seamless access to content without repeated age checks.

## Installation

To use this userscript, you will need a userscript manager. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is recommended as it is compatible with most browsers.

### Steps:

1. **Install Tampermonkey:**
   - Go to the Tampermonkey website and choose the version that suits your browser. Install it as you would any other browser extension.

2. **Add the Userscript:**
   - Open your Tampermonkey dashboard by clicking the Tampermonkey icon in your browser and selecting "Dashboard".
   - Go to the "Utilities" tab and under "URL" paste the link to the raw `.user.js` file hosted on [Greasy Fork](https://update.greasyfork.org/scripts/494477/Age%20Gate%20Bypass%20for%20Epic%20Games%20Store%20and%20Steam.user.js).
   - Save the script by clicking on the disk icon or pressing `Ctrl + S`.

3. **Enable the Script:**
   - Ensure the script is enabled in the Tampermonkey dashboard. It should appear in the list of installed scripts with a check mark or enabled toggle next to it.

## Usage

Once installed, the script will automatically run on the relevant pages of the Epic Games Store and Steam. It will bypass age gates by setting the appropriate cookies automatically. There is no need for manual interaction.

### Notes:
- This script is designed to improve convenience by bypassing repetitive age verification prompts.
